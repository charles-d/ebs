</table>
<p>Insanity is a workout regimen similar to P90X in that it claims to improve fitness in
60 days through strenuous stamina training. Developed by Shaun T., Insanity emphasizes
"max interval training", working out strenuously for 3–4 minutes and then rests or
"cools down" for approximately 30 seconds before starting the process over. This is more
intense than traditional interval training, during which participants alternate mild and
strenuous exercise for roughly equal lengths of time. This program claims to promote
noticeable results through core strength, as well as intense cardio training. Bring a
sweat towel and water bottle. Room temperature water for sale $1.
