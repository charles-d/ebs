In 2007 she received her advance teaching certification from the International Society of Teachers of Dancing. During her amateur career (2002-2006), Desireé achieved 10 and 9 dance status competing Amateur Standard, Latin, Rhythm, and Smooth. Her achievements include many regional and National titles including National Smooth Finalist 2005. In 2005, she started coaching pre-teen, junior, youth formation teams and competitive couples in Utah. Year after year her teams won National Championships and acquired many National Titles. Desireé met her husband Charles at BYU. They competed in Amateur Latin for two years. They were married in November 2006 and Desireé turned Professional shortly after. They have two sons Evan who is 2, and Asher who is 8 months old. Both boys love to dance.
<p>Since moving to California over 6 years ago, Desireé has established herself by creating and directing the Bay Area Elite Dance Company in 2008 and opening Elite Ballroom Studio in 2011. In addition to full time wife and mother, she works as CEO of Elite Ballroom, Artistic Director and Choreographer for the BAE Dance Company, and as a private ballroom dance coach for multiple couples in the Bay Area. She commutes all over the country for multiple groups as their guest choreographer and continues to coach youth formation teams all over the country.
